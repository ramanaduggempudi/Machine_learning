## Linear Regression
- **Implementation**: [Linear Regression Code](./linear_regression.py)
- **Explanation**: Linear regression is a linear model that predicts a continuous output variable based on one or more predictor variables.

## Logistic Regression
- **Implementation**: [Logistic Regression Code](./logistic_regression.py)
- **Explanation**: Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems.

## Decision Trees
- **Implementation**: [Decision Trees Code](./decision_trees.py)
- **Explanation**: Decision trees are used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Random Forests
- **Implementation**: [Random Forests Code](./random_forests.py)
- **Explanation**: Random forests are ensemble methods that combine multiple decision trees.

## Support Vector Machines
- **Implementation**: [SVMs Code](./svm.py)
- **Explanation**: SVMs are used for classification tasks and can handle high-dimensional data.
